# assignment Features:

Your task is basically to build a small web application that you can use to keep track of your (bike/motorbike/car) trips. You should be able to create new trips by uploading a .gpx file. It should then be imported to the database (think of a fitting db-schema for this) and you should be able to give it a name (bonus: and use google maps to view the trip. You can use http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/ to find out how to display gps coordinates in a google map.).
